# Run from the fat man

## Summary
This is a simple game to practice using Python and the `pygame` package.

It is based on [this](https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-make-a-game-in-python-1136589/) game.

## How to play
The aim of the game is to collect five or more points without the fat man
catching you.

You will either be the pink or the light blue square. The former moves with
_WASD_ and the latter with the arrow keys.

Points are obtained by touching the red ball. The white square is the exit
which can only be accessed after collecting five points by either player.

If the fat man touches you the game finishes and you get two points taken from
your score.
